# aleshkev.github.io

My personal website. Created completely by myself (see [`source/README.md`](source/README.md) for details).

Source code (Python, SASS, `.cmd`) uses [MIT License](LICENSE.md), while all of [`source/content/`](source/content/) is under [exclusive copyright](source/content/LICENSE.md).

The site is statically built into the `a/` folder. I set up an `index.html` file, which redirects immediately from `https://aleshkev.github.io/` to `https://aleshkev.github.io/a/`.

Hosted on Github pages, [aleshkev.github.io](https://aleshkev.github.io). I might buy myself some nice domain in the future.
